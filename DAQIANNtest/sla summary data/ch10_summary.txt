* Since the mid-1990s, there is an ongoing social turn in SLA that has its roots in social constructivism, socioculturalism and poststructuralism and posits that we can only understand L2 learning if we examine it fully embedded in its social context.
* Vygotskian sociocultural theory respeciﬁes cognition as fundamentally social and proposes consciousness as the central function of human cognition and the main object of inquiry; language is used to create thought, it also transforms thought, and it is the source of learning.
* The main concepts to remember in Vygotskian sociocultural theory are: language as a symbolic tool; mediation through object, others and self; social, private and inner speech; the emergence of self-regulation; and the Zone of Proximal Development.
* The Vygotskian approach to SLA conceives of L2 learning as joint activity in which construction of co-knowledge is enabled and in which self-regulation is facilitated and negotiated through different kinds of mediation.
* L2 learning is captured through the microgenetic method during meditated thought and talk in L2 and L1 and it is evaluated not as already attained development but as potential improvement towards self-regulation for the future.
* CA-for-SLA investigates the socio-interactional accomplishments of L2 learners as they do communication, and it reconceptualizes into interactional resources actions and solutions that other approaches may take for evidence of deﬁciency.
* By following the radically emic imperative of grounding interpretive claims in the observable or witnessable evidence of interactional actions, CA-for- SLA proposes that a number of categories (e.g. error, negotiation for meaning, learner identity, linguistic expertise) have no constant value but are made relevant or irrelevant anew in each local interaction and each turn- at-talk.
* Co-participants in an L2 interaction typically, but not always, co-orient to joint interactional action and interactional identities. The external contexts and settings make some orientations, identities and goals more available than others, but they do not completely determine them.
* Systemic Functional Linguistics respeciﬁes grammar as a social semiotic process, that is, as the social action of meaning making. The framework has been applied to L2 learning more readily in order to describe the textual challenges of L2 learners but less often to investigate semiotic development in the L2.
* The development of academic repertoires can be studied by inspecting textual changes in lexical density, grammatical metaphor and grammatical intricacy longitudinally; all three qualities are related to semiotic processes involved in making formal language less grammatically congruent and more informationally dense than everyday language.
* Functional recasts and appraisal systems are two other areas in which some SFL-inspired efforts at studying semiotic development in an L2 have been made.
* Language socialization theory sees language learning and social learning as constitutive of each other; it investigates how, through social activity with willing experts, newcomers gain not only language knowledge but also membership and legitimacy in a given group or community.
* In L2 studies, language socialization researchers have concentrated on studying what kinds of access to the new language and what conditions of participation in the new community support or hinder L2 learners’ appropriation of the linguistic and cultural resources needed to be accepted in a new context as a competent member.
* The outcomes of language socialization are far reaching and include normative ways of viewing the world. That is, by increasingly participating more actively in activities with others, learners acquire new ways of saying, doing and being.
* Identity theory reconceptualizes sense of self as socially constructed and socially constrained and shows how this construct helps explain different language learning trajectories and their outcomes.
* The main concepts to remember in identity theory are: investment, communities of practice, imagined communities and the right to speak.
* Identity, ideology and power are intertwined and help understand L2 learning.
* In contexts for circumstantial as well as elective L2 learning, learners struggle to fashion identities that allow them to exercise their agency and be viewed positively by others; possible identities are made available by surrounding discourses in social structures that yield unequal power; learners have some agency to negotiate, resist, accommodate or change their identities across time and space.
* Technology-based communication affords L2 learners rich opportunities for identity negotiation and reconstruction and social and cultural learning, as well as unprecedented support for literacy development.
* The social perspectives on L2 learning discussed in this chapter, and particularly among them the poststructuralist approaches, suggest that L2 learning is never just about language; for many, perhaps most, people who undertake to learn an additional language, it is about succeeding in attaining material, symbolic and affective returns that they desire for themselves and it is also about being considered by others as worthy social beings. In both cases, learners are engaged in changing their worlds, and thus L2 learning is always transformative.
