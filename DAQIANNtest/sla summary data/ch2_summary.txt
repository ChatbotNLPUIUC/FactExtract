* In terms of L2 learning rate, adults and older children enjoy an initial advantage over young children that may last over up to one year, some- times up to three years, particularly if they are tested through tasks that demand cognitive maturity and involve metalinguistic skills. After ﬁve years, however, early starters catch up and are better than late starters in second language contexts. In foreign language contexts, by contrast, the lagged advantage for an earlier start has not been observed, even after ﬁve years.
* In terms of L2 ultimate attainment, most learners who begin acquiring the L2 before a certain age, typically before puberty, will develop levels of morphosyntactic and phonological competence that are very close to those of native speakers of that language. Post-pubertal learners, however, are not likely to perform in the native speaker range, and this holds true regardless of the number of years they have resided in the L2 environment.
* Exceptions to the observed success and failure tendencies associated with age exist. Thus, some adult starters can achieve native-like levels in their L2, or at least extremely high levels that are near-native. Conversely, an early start does not guarantee complete and successful L2 acquisition in all cases, as some children who start learning the L2 at an age as early as four or even two may be found to differ from native speaker performance in subtle ways. In the former case, exceptions appear to be related to unusually high motivation and high quality of instruction, whereas in the latter case they appear to be associated with high L1-use levels (that is, with high L1 activation or L1 dominance).
* Several explanations for the observed age effects have been proposed and are considered plausible by different SLA researchers. Those in favour of a critical period explanation posit that, after a certain age, it is biologically impossible for the human brain to use the same processes that were involved in learning the L1. Instead, other processes, such as reasoning and problem solving, are summoned during post-pubertal L2 learning. Several neurological and neurochemical causes have been considered (including lateralization, plasticity, myelination and pubertal increases in oestrogen or testosterone) but the empirical evidence is still unavailable for any of them. Of the researchers who favour non-biological explanations, some have considered pre-existing knowledge of the L1 and others have emphasized socio-educational and affective-motivational forces.
* Recent research suggests that bilingualism effects (e.g. L1–L2 interactions) and language activation and dominance effects (i.e. relative amounts of L1 versus L2 use) operate across all ages, beginning as early as age two. This evidence suggests that it may be misguided to compare bilingual attainment to monolingual attainment. Thus, in the future, research programmes may need to shift away from the emphasis on a fundamental difference between monolingual child L1 acquisition and monolingual-like adult L2 acquisition and towards investigating changes in the brain and in cognitive processing that are shaped by the experience that results from being exposed to more than one language simultaneously or sequentially and across varying ages.
