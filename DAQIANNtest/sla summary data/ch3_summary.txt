* By deﬁnition L2 acquisition takes place in humans who already possess one or more languages. This being so, the mother tongue (and any other known languages) universally inﬂuences the processes and outcomes of L2 learning.
* Transfer is a highly complex phenomenon. It can be caused by perceived L1–L2 similarities as well as by large differences, and it goes well beyond strident calques and awkward transliterations from the L1.
* The inﬂuence of the mother tongue cannot explain all phenomena in interlanguage development, because universal inﬂuences that operate in all natural languages exercise a powerful effect also on L2 development. Knowledge of the L1 interacts with such developmental forces but does not override them.
* Pre-existing knowledge of the mother tongue inﬂuences interlanguage development by accelerating or delaying the progress learners make along the natural, developmental pathways (e.g. orders of accuracy, natural sequences and developmental stages), but it neither predetermines nor alters such pathways.
* What gets or does not get transferred is also in part determined by: universal constraints and processes, such as developmental sequences and markedness, that apply across all natural languages and play a role in L1 as well as L2 acquisition; psychological perceptions of transferability; inherent complexity of the L2 subsystem in question; proﬁciency level.
* Crosslinguistic inﬂuences, even in cases of negative transfer, may or may not lead to ungrammatical solutions. Transfer can be manifested in errors of commission, errors of omission (avoidance) and L1-patterned frequencies (underuse and overuse). It can also result in subtle effects beyond form–form or form–function misidentiﬁcations and can occur at all levels of language, from information structure, to pragmatics, to thinking-for- speaking.
* L1 transfer does not happen mechanistically or deterministically. Rather, it is about tendencies and probabilities. Consciously or unconsciously, learners seem to operate on the basis of two complementary principles: ‘what works in the L1 may work in the L2 because human languages are fundamentally alike’ but ‘if it sounds too L1-like, it will probably not work in the L2’.
* Knowledge of two (or more) languages can accelerate the learning of an additional one, and all previously known languages can inﬂuence knowledge of and performance in an L3.
