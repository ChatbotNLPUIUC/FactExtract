* The ﬁve environmental ingredients that together contribute to (but do not guarantee) optimal L2 learning are: acculturated attitudes, comprehensible input, negotiated interaction, pushed output, and a capacity, natural or cultivated, to attend to the language code, not just the message. These ﬁve ingredients were likely present in a case like Julie (see Chapter 2, section 2.2), the ﬁrst of several exceptionally successful learners discovered since the mid-1990s. The last ingredient, attention to the language code, was fundamentally missing from a case like Wes (see Chapter 4, section 4.1), who epitomizes the frequently attested phenomenon of mixed learning success.
* Neither positive attitudes towards the target language and its speakers nor abundant and meaningful comprehension of L2 messages are in and of themselves sufﬁcient for second language learning to be successful, although both are certainly important ingredients in a highly complex environmental equation.
* For successful grammar acquisition, attention to form is probably necessary. This attentional focus on form can be externally achieved by instruction or internally sought by self-study and self-directed analysis of the linguistic material available in the environment.
* Negotiation for meaning, other- and self-initiated output modiﬁcation, negotiation of form during collaboration, and negative feedback of varying degrees of explicitness all carry potential for learning, provided they occur under optimal conditions that recruit attention to the language code. They facilitate psycholinguistic and metalinguistic processes of segmenting the input, noticing gaps and holes, parsing messages syntactically, monitoring and hypothesis testing; these are in turn processes that help L2 learners crack the language code.
* In the process of collaboratively negotiating choices of the code, L2 users generate language-related episodes (LREs) or pre-emptive focus-on-form episodes which are potential sites for learning. Using the L1 or metalanguage during these events may aid learning.
* Cognitive-interactionist researchers agree that negative feedback (or the implicit or explicit indication that some part of an utterance is ungrammatical) is better overall than entirely ignoring errors. Much less agreement has been reached as to when, how and why negative feedback works, when it does.
* Recent evidence strongly suggests that the effectiveness of negative feedback is moderated by at least two factors: the degree of explicitness with which it is implemented, and the wider instructional orientation towards language as a meaning-making tool or as object for learning.
* The value of comprehension versus production for acquisition is an ill- understood conundrum that causes disagreement among SLA researchers. Some view learning as driven by comprehension exclusively and assign production a role for ﬂuency-building. Others claim that productive, meaningful language use is in itself a catalyst for learning.
* Grammatical competence appears to evolve in ways that are less amenable to incidental beneﬁts from the environment than other aspects of the language to be learned, such as vocabulary, discourse competence, and so on. It also seems to hold a special status in language acquisition. Speciﬁcally, grammar (a) requires more interest, attention and hard work than other aspects of the language to be learned; (b) may even require more time to simmer and deploy than the learning of other aspects of an L2; and (c) can act as a gatekeeper to development in other areas of the L2 beyond formulaic repertoires, particularly sociolinguistic competence.
* What matters in the linguistic environment is not simply ‘what’s out there’ physically or even socially surrounding learners, but rather what learners make of it, how they process (or not) the linguistic data and how they live and experience that environment.
