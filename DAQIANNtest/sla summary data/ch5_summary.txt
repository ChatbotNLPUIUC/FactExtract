* Information processing theories assume that: (a) the human cognitive architecture is made of representation and access; (b) mental processing is comprised of automatic or ﬂuent (unconscious) operations and voluntary or controlled (conscious) operations; (c) cognitive resources such as attention and memory are limited; and (d) performance is variable and vulnerable to stressors, as shown during dual-task performance.
* A particular kind of information processing theory called skill acquisition theory explains L2 learning as the process of gradual transformation of performance from controlled to automatic, via proceduralization, or meaningful practice that is sustained over time.
* Proceduralization leads to automatization, which is a quality of ﬂuent, automatic performance that goes beyond sheer speed.
* The beneﬁt of practice drops off at some point in the learning curve due to the power law of learning; the beneﬁts of practice are skill-speciﬁc.
* Prolonged and repeated meaningful practice changes the knowledge representation itself; with repeated access, the stored knowledge becomes more elaborated, well speciﬁed and analysed.
* Memory is composed of two types, long-term memory and working memory, which interact.
* Long-term memory is about representations and it is unlimited; it can be explicit-declarative (the facts and events we know and can talk about) or implicit-procedural (knowledge we do not know we hold, but which affects our behaviour and supports our skills, habits and performance). Another distinction that has received less attention in SLA is between semantic memory (decontextualized knowledge) and episodic memory (knowledge encoded with information about the lived experiences in which we acquired it).
* How L2 vocabulary is encoded in long-term memory has resulted in research about the strength, size and depth of word knowledge, as well as various theories about the content of the entries in the mental bilingual lexicon and how the L1 and L2 lexicons interact during lexical access.
* Working memory is about access and it is limited; it controls what information can be stored momentarily (the issue of storage) and how well and how long it can be activated and integrated with already known information in long-term memory (the issue of processing); it is the site for controlled processing and consciousness.
* It is known that working memory capacity is smaller in the L2 than the L1, and it is assumed that this lag narrows with increasing proﬁciency; there is also debate as to whether passive or active measures of working memory are more suitable to investigate the relationship between working memory and L2 learning. SLA researchers have not investigated these issues systematically yet. More is known about working memory capacity and individual differences in L2 learning, which we will examine in Chapter 7 (sections 7.7 and 7.8).
* Attention is thought to be central to understanding L2 learning. Attention is limited and selective, and it can be voluntary and accessible to consciousness. Several questions have been investigated in SLA with regard to attention.
* Is L2 learning possible without intention? Yes, incidental learning, or learning without intention, is possible in L2 learning. The best-known example is the incidental learning of L2 vocabulary while reading for pleasure. However, people learn faster, more and better when they learn deliberately or with intention.
* Is L2 learning possible without attention? Examination of this question has taken the form of a debate over whether detection (registration outside focal attention) is sufﬁcient for L2 learning or whether noticing (detection plus activation into the focus of attention) is also required. The jury is still out, but rather than investigating the qualities of attention that are necessary for learning, most studies have examined the issue of awareness.
* Is L2 learning possible without awareness? This question cannot be directly answered, because zero awareness may be methodologically impossible to establish. However, awareness (as measured through reports of noticing and understanding during think-aloud protocols) has been shown to be related to higher post-test scores, suggesting that noticing with awareness is facilitative of L2 learning.
* Is L2 learning possible without rules? In the absence of rules, low-level associative learning is certainly possible. This kind of learning draws on data-driven processes supported by memory. With rules, learning proceeds by drawing on controlled operations and conceptually driven processes supported by conscious attention. Both types of processing of new L2 material can lead to learning, and both can interact. A pending question for future research is whether all aspects of an L2 are equally learnable by implicit means or whether some particularly complex aspects of the L2 may require conceptually driven processing in order for associations and representations to be formed.
* An imminent emergentist turn has made inroads into several research programmes about cognition in SLA. Emergentism refers to a contemporary family of theories in cognitive science that reconceptualizes information processing as an associative, probabilistic, rational, usage- based, grounded, dynamic and, in sum, emergent adaptation of the agent to the environment.
* It is difﬁcult to predict how long it will take for emergentist SLA to really come to fruition and so far the publications offer discussions and expositions more than they offer L2-speciﬁc empirical evidence. Emergentism will likely ﬂourish in cognitive SLA in future years, however, judging from the pervasiveness of emergentist thought in many other areas of the cognitive sciences.
