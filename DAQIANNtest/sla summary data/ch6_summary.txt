* This chapter focuses on the study of learner language from the perspective of interlanguage studies, a tradition that emphasizes general cognitive explanations for the development of L2 morphology and syntax and draws on evidence from both experimental and free production data.
* ‘Interlanguage’, a term coined by Selinker in 1972, is the language system that each learner constructs at any given point in development; it is a natural language characterized by systematicity and variability; and it is more than the sum of the target input and the L1 inﬂuence.
* A family of usage-based and emergentist theories offers promising explanations for language learning and posits that: (a) language learning is driven by experience and induction of generalizations; (b) important inﬂuences on development arise from frequency and salience in the input and from attention and categorization processes in the learner; (c) variability is central to development; and (d) language learning must be explained by the simultaneous interaction of multiple forces.
* According to usage-based accounts, rules emerge from experience as follows. Learners register frequently encountered form–meaning pairings and implicitly tally their frequencies, distributions and contexts; upon repeated encounters, memorized formulas eventually give way to the abstracting of low-scope patterns; given sufﬁcient experience and favourable conditions, low-scope patterns can give rise to abstract constructions.
* Aided by memory and experience, four interlanguage processes are at work as the internal grammar develops: simpliﬁcation, overgeneralization, restructuring and U-shaped behaviour. Ge’s acquisition of the English article the (Huebner, 1983) offers a good illustration of all four processes.
* Interlanguage change is always systematic (a matter of development), but also non-linear (a matter of accuracy) and unevenly paced (a matter of rate). All three dimensions of development, accuracy and rate are necessary to jointly characterize interlanguage change over time. Jorge’s acquisition of English negation (Cancino et al., 1978; Stauble, 1978) illustrates the three dimensions at work.
* Within a year and a half of immersion in the L2 environment, most naturalistic adult learners will develop a rudimentary but systematic and fully communicative system, called the Basic Variety by Klein and Perdue (1997). After some more time, and probably pushed by the need to communicate complex messages, many but not all of them will grammaticalize resources and develop morphology and subordination.
* We know that a set of English morphemes is mastered at 80 per cent or 90 per cent accuracy levels in a predictable order, which is at least in good part explained by the combined frequency and salience of these morphemes in the input.
* We know that in English, Spanish and many other target languages, the emergence of tense and aspect morphology is patterned and strongly shaped by the semantics of the verb. The details of how this happens have been spelled out in the Aspect Hypothesis (Andersen and Shirai, 1996) and supported in many studies and across many L2s.
* Relativization is another area in which development has proved to be systematic rather than random. Learners of a wide number of target languages are seen to be able to relativize in more frequent and less marked positions (e.g. subject, direct object) before they can do so in less frequent and more marked positions (e.g. object of preposition).
* Several word order phenomena across target languages, including German and English, have been mapped along cumulative developmental sequences that describe how the full repertoire of word order possibilities in a language emerges in a systematic but gradual and non-linear fashion.
* Fossilization is a technical term used to refer to cases when L2 development comes to a seemingly permanent stop. For some researchers, fossilization is the inevitable end result of all L2 learning; for other researchers, fossilization is a premature cessation of learning that affects some learners but not others. There are several studies of learners who allegedly fossilized (e.g. Alberto, Patty, Geng and Fong, and quite a few others not mentioned in this chapter). However, conceptual and methodological difﬁculties make fossilization a contested construct that must be regarded with caution.
* The value of instruction is doubted by researchers who endorse a nativist and modular view of language learning, but it is supported by researchers who endorse a general cognitive view of language learning, and who believe in the possibility of an interface between explicit and implicit knowledge.
* Instruction cannot override development, but it has been shown to result in clear beneﬁts in the areas of accuracy and rate of learning for both syntax and morphology.
* A great challenge will be to ﬁnd ways of studying learner language in its own right, rather than as an imperfect version of the target grammar; it is yet to be seen if future innovations will help overcome teleological notions of development as convergence towards the representations assumed of an ideal monolingual native speaker.
