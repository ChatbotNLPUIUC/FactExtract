* Language aptitude is the psychological formulation behind the intuition that some people have a gift for additional language learning while others seem to struggle.
 * At a practical level, it can be measured by existing tests that predict how well someone is likely to do when embarking on the formal study of an additional language. The best known and most widely employed test of language aptitude is the MLAT, although several other tests also exist.
* Scores on the MLAT and other aptitude tests correlate with proﬁciency levels, ﬁnal course grades, or teacher ratings in the order of r = 0.40 to r = 0.60. This is a considerable shared variance between 16 per cent and 36 per cent.
* Two challenges have importantly limited our ability to understand L2 aptitude in the past: the investment of much less effort in explaining the construct than in developing tests that measure it; and the difﬁculty of extracting the cognitive abilities from the conative, affective and contextual affordances of the environments in which L2 learning happens.
* Language aptitude partially overlaps with traditional intelligence and with early ﬁrst language ability. Language aptitude and traditional intelligence may share a subset of academic abilities implicated in both types of test; language aptitude and early ﬁrst language ability may share a common substrate of grammatical sensitivity and analytical kinds of abilities. Despite the partial overlaps, each of the three constructs is also distinct enough to be worthy of study in its own right.
* Language aptitude is also related to differential abilities implicated in the development of literacy during the early school years. That is, language- related learning difﬁculties when learning to read in the L1 may resurface later on when studying another language. The common substrate resides in abilities to handle phonological–orthographic processing operations and include the constructs of phonological awareness, phonemic awareness and phonological decoding.
* Differential memory capacities are thought to play a central part in creating differential likelihoods of success when learning a foreign language. Memory alone is thought to help predict how well people will learn new vocabulary, what levels of comprehension they will achieve in listening or reading, how much they may beneﬁt from recasts or how easily they will learn a grammar rule.
* However, a complex picture of memory and differential L2 facility and success emerges in the available evidence. For example, good short-term memory facilitates vocabulary learning at beginning stages, but this predictive power wanes for more advanced learners. Good memory may boost learning of vocabulary ﬁrst, and confer an advantage in the learning of surface grammatical phenomena (but perhaps not all rules alike) later in the course of L2 study.
* We do not know for sure (a) whether language aptitude matters only (or mostly) for late L2 starters and (b) whether equally strong differences in language aptitude emerge when the learning conditions call for memory- driven, implicit ways versus analytical, explicit ways of processing the new material. These two questions are of extreme theoretical and practical importance, but have been insufﬁciently studied to date.
* At a theoretical level, language aptitude as a construct is thought to be made up of various cognitive abilities, some better understood than others, but all related to two broad types: analytical abilities and memory abilities.
* Recent efforts to reconceptualize language aptitude beyond the two kinds of broad ability have been made by Skehan and Robinson. The strength of both proposals is that they make it possible to study L2 aptitude as a well- motivated, textured set of cognitive capacities that correspond to theoretically postulated processing demands that are speciﬁc to L2 learning.
* In the future, the two proposals may also help to understand better how instructional approaches can be designed to boost L2 learning success for a greater variety of individual needs.
