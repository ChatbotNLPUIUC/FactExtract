* Motivation is usually understood to refer to the desire to initiate L2 learning and the effort employed to sustain it. We can measure different aspects and dimensions of motivation reliably through questionnaires, by focusing on motivational quantity (e.g. Gardner’s AMTB), motivational quality (e.g. Noels and colleagues’ LLOS) and antecedents of motivation such as orientations and attitudes.
* Integrativeness is deﬁned as ‘a genuine interest in learning the second language in order to come closer to the other language community’ (Gardner, 2001, p. 5). While this construct has often been misunderstood and its relevance to foreign language settings was for some time doubted, the centrality of integrativeness seems rather resilient (Csizér and Dörnyei, 2005b). What seems obsolete is the narrow focus on identiﬁcation with the L2 speakers and culture; integrativeness, however, can be more productively redeﬁned as a drive to close the gap or discrepancy between the actual self and an ideal self, who in highly L2 motivated individuals happens to have been conceived as an L2-speaking self.
* Many antecedents of motivation have been investigated, but broad motives to learn (or orientations) and social perceptions towards the target L2 and community (or attitudes) have been most extensively explicated. Orientations and attitudes vary across contexts for L2 learning, including second versus foreign language contexts, but also unilingual versus multilingual contexts, and contexts where the L2 has attached symbolic values related to globalization or to immediate political conﬂict.
* A healthy crisis during the mid-1990s called into question the hegemony of Gardner’s motivation model and caused the L2 motivation community to turn to a variety of theories of motivation available in wider social psychological research. Particularly useful has been the adaptation of theories that focused on motivational quality rather than quantity, such as self-determination theory.
* Another positive outcome of the crisis was the push for expanding motivation research beyond just a few contexts (and particularly the French–English Canadian context). Many important insights have been possible only after researchers have opened up to investigating diverse contexts.
* Attitudes towards the formal learning context have been shown to exert a lasting and important inﬂuence on motivation. In particular, positive attitudes towards the learning context as well as the L2 community and culture (developed through prior positive learning experiences) and current satisfaction with teachers and instruction can boost motivation considerably. It follows that motivational changes, including changes for the better that can be planned and orchestrated in the curriculum, are at the reach of teachers and educators (Dörnyei, 1994).
* Even newer perspectives have been a most recent but also most natural addition to this vibrant landscape of change. The main thrust for these changes is the recognition that L2 motivation is dynamic rather than static, which in turn has resulted in increased attention to time, context and behaviour. These themes are likely to be integrated in future research with what is an important new concept: the ideal L2-speaking self.
