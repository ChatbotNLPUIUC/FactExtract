* Learning and using an L2 poses a threat to one’s ego and makes people vulnerable. Under such conditions, the affective reactions developed by individuals towards the L2 and their own L2 speaking and L2 learning self can vary. Some people may be psychologically better equipped than others for managing affective reactions during L2 learning.
* Certain personality traits may favour interest in the study of an L2 and increase the likelihood of success. It appears that intuitive thinkers are likely to be attracted to the study of foreign languages, perhaps because they enjoy the intuiting or holistic demands of working with words and meaning symbols as well as the thinking or analytical demands of grammatical analysis. Rather unexpectedly, many introverts are also attracted to the study of foreign languages.
* Openness to experience has emerged in recent research as a potentially important personality variable that may be auspicious for achieving high levels of success in L2 learning. This personality trait may be related to lack of ethnocentrism, self-conﬁdence and creativity, among other qualities that may be important for L2 learning.
* Some personality traits (extraversion) and speaking predispositions (concern for communication versus accuracy) appear to be related to speaking styles that are most directly measurable via ﬂuency effects. Introverts and L2 speakers concerned for accuracy produce less ﬂuent speech, searching for better lexical terms and rephrasing themselves more. These speaking styles are traditionally explained as ﬂuency–accuracy trade- offs, but the lack of actual accuracy or self-correction effects in the available studies suggests that they may in fact be better conceived of as ﬂuency–complexity trade-offs instead.
* Foreign language anxiety is a measurable, L2 speciﬁc affective variable that is associated with a number of symptoms, including lower grades, lower proﬁciency performances, difﬁculty with processing and learning new L2 material, reticence and L2 risk-avoiding behaviours. Its roots can be found in overall low self-concept regarding general academic abilities and in unrealistic beliefs about language learning. The consequences of anxiety are difﬁcult to predict, however, because anxiety can have facilitative as well as debilitating effects for different individuals.
* Willingness to communicate (WTC) is deﬁned as the self-reported likelihood for an L2 learner to want to initiate communication in the L2 when given the choice to engage in or to avoid such action. The antecedents of L2 WTC are L2 communicative conﬁdence (which itself is predicted by anxiety and self-perceived competence) and to a lesser but nevertheless considerable extent by L2 attitudes. Such attitudes are shaped by the frequency and quality of past L2 contact but they also help shape willingness to seek and engage in future L2 contact. Context matters a good deal in understanding the relative importance of WTC antecedents and consequences. Two important areas for pending research are how WTC may be related to actual increases in L2 contact-seeking behaviours, and how it can change across time and contexts.
* Cognitive or learning styles are ways in which individuals prefer to put their general cognitive abilities to use. They are neither good nor bad, but simply bipolar dimensions, with potential strengths and weaknesses on both extremes. A cognitive style investigated in SLA is ﬁeld independence. Individuals who are high on the ﬁeld-independence pole of this construct may be better at detecting patterns in the L2 input, dealing with grammatical rules and being able to self-monitor during L2 production. Individuals who are high on the ﬁeld-dependence pole (also called ﬁeld sensitivity by Ehrman and Leaver, 2003) may be better at learning holistically from input via memorization as well as learning through communication with others.
* An encompassing mega-model of synoptic–ectenic learning styles has been proposed by Ehrman and Leaver (2003). Synopsis is related to the preference to rely on holistic, at-a-glance perception of information, whereas ectasis refers to the preference to rely on detail and system when processing new information.
* Learning strategies are conscious mental and behavioural procedures that people engage in with the aim to gain control over their learning process. Strategies can be cognitive (among which memory-related and compensatory strategies are important), metacognitive, social and affective. Strategy use appears to be greatly shaped by the curricular context and the speciﬁc tasks at hand.
* It has been relatively easy to describe how L2 learners use strategies. More difﬁcult has been to establish a link between strategic behaviour and actual learning gains, to demonstrate that strategies are not culturally biased, or to explain why poor strategy users differ from good strategy users only in how they use strategies in context but not in the kinds or frequency of strategy they use.
* A recent alternative to the study of strategic behaviour is self-regulation, a theory of how humans take control over their actions, thoughts and feelings in order to achieve their complex goals. A promising innovation in this framework is that the traditional emphasis on sheer frequency of strategy use is being replaced by an emphasis on the creativity of efforts employed to control one’s learning processes.
